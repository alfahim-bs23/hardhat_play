# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a feature to deploy that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```

1. Run blocks
```shell
npx hardhat block-number --network sepolia
```

2. Run deploy.js
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```
